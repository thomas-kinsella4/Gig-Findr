Gig Findr.

Your one stop shop to find local NYC booking agents looking for artists to perform at their music venues.
You can create an account as an agent or an artist and have everything you need to book artists, or find gigs to play.
Gig Findr was built using React.js for it's front end and Ruby on Rails for it's backend. Gig Findr uses Cloudinary to capture and store user images as well as user music files. Bcrypt is used to implement user authentication, account creation, secure sensitive user info, and validate login status to ensure users can access correct application features. The UI was designed using all custom CSS. 

Run npm install to install and run GigFindr.

Have fun finding gigs.
